# Miuul - Machine Learning Training and Projects

Hello!

This repository has been created to showcase my completion of the Miuul - Machine Learning training and my practical application of various machine learning concepts. Throughout this training, I covered a broad spectrum of topics, ranging from grasping the foundational concepts to exploring diverse subjects such as linear and logistic regression, KNN, CART, advanced tree methods, unsupervised learning, and artificial learning.

## Training Content

During the training, the modules encompassed the following fundamental areas:

- Fundamental Concepts: Introducing machine learning terminology and principles.
- Linear Regression: Understanding the basics of linear regression and implementing it with real-world examples.
- Logistic Regression: Addressing classification problems and employing logistic regression.
- KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors): Utilizing the neighborhood-based classification technique.
- CART (Classification and Regression Trees): Delving into decision trees and the CART algorithm.
- Advanced Tree Methods: Exploring ensemble methods and GBM.
- Unsupervised Learning: Investigating clustering and dimensionality reduction methods.
- Pipeline and Artificial Learning: Understanding data processing flows and the steps involved in model creation.

## Projects

Throughout the training journey, I developed projects in various machine learning areas using real-world datasets:

1. **Linear Regression Application:** Constructed a linear regression model using a dataset to make predictions and drew a suitable line of best fit.

2. **Logistic Regression Application:** Employed logistic regression to solve classification problems and categorized data points accordingly.

3. **KNN Application:** Utilized the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to classify data points and make predictions based on their proximity.

4. **CART Application:** Analyzed and visualized a dataset using classification and regression trees (CART).

5. **Advanced Tree Methods Project:** Worked on a classification or regression problem using advanced tree methods such as GBM (Gradient Boosting Machine).

6. **Unsupervised Learning Project:** Explored clustering or dimensionality reduction methods to analyze and group data points in a dataset.

7. **Pipeline and Model Selection Application:** Designed and implemented a pipeline involving data preprocessing, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to the Miuul - Machine Learning training, I have gained a solid understanding of machine learning concepts. This repository serves as a platform where I've translated what I learned during the training into practical applications. My heartfelt thanks go to everyone who contributed to my successful completion of this training.

Please note that translations may benefit from the expertise of a professional translator for the best results.
